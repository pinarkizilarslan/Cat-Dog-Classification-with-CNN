# Cat - Dog Classification with CNN

In the project, it was classified by finding whether the image given as an example belongs to a cat or a dog.

The aim of the project is to use the Neural Network, to understand and compare its algorithms.
An example of binary classification was made by using the advantages of CNN, one of the important algorithms of the Neural Network.
A success rate of 85% was obtained from the tested images.

The project was developed with Python in Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook interface.

You can check the Neural.ipynb file in the app folder.
You can test it with an image you upload to the dataset/single_prediction/ path.
